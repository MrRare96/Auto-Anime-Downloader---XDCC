// botname cannot be changed for now, when you do, it wont work and download the wrong file
// ircruntime is in minutes, calculate this: 1000/internet speed in megabite / s <- not megabit! isps tend to to tell you this 90/9 dl/up speed, which is actually 9 mb/s download and 0.9 mb/s upload. so for example mine would be: 1000/9 = Â± 111 meaning to download
one gigabite takes 111 seconds which is 1minute51secs. meaning I would need to set 2 min on ircruntime. My rpi connection tends to be slower so i take double.
